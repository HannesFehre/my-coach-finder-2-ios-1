# üö® CRITICAL: Certificate is Corrupted in Codemagic

## The Problem
The certificate stored in Codemagic's `CM_CERTIFICATE` variable is corrupted. It doesn't match ANY password, which means:
- Either the base64 was incorrectly copied
- Or Codemagic truncated/modified the value
- Or there are hidden characters

## Immediate Fix Steps

### Option 1: Copy Certificate from Server (RECOMMENDED)

SSH into your server and run:
```bash
cat /home/liz/Desktop/Module/MyCoachFinder/app/appel/certificates/ios_distribution_simple_base64.txt
```

**IMPORTANT**:
- Copy the ENTIRE output (4,272 characters)
- It's ONE LONG LINE - no line breaks
- Starts with: `MIIMfwIBAzCCDDUGCSqGSIb3DQEHAaCCDCYEggwiMIIMHjCC`
- Ends with: `+i3nGyyYxzElMCMGCSqGSIb3DQEJFTEWBBQcGu/wiKJdcKpH/DE9o/clIcCPKzBBMDEwDQYJYIZIAWUDBAIBBQAEIGHk8khm7+a9r/Vh2dyeqW0BJgbJSOUheEmXE2lJFY/RBAgiYtEljMa0hgICCAA=`

### Option 2: Download and Copy

1. Download this file: `/home/liz/Desktop/Module/MyCoachFinder/app/appel/certificates/ios_distribution_simple_base64.txt`
2. Open it in a text editor
3. Copy ALL content (it's one long line)

### Then Update Codemagic

1. Go to: https://codemagic.io/apps
2. Select: **my-coach-finder-2-ios-1**
3. Navigate to: **Environment variables** ‚Üí **`ios_signing` group**
4. Update these TWO variables:

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `CM_CERTIFICATE` | *Paste the entire 4,272 character string* |
| `CM_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` | `MyCoachFinder2024` |

5. **IMPORTANT CHECKS**:
   - Make sure there are NO spaces before or after the certificate
   - Make sure it's ONE LINE (no line breaks)
   - Make sure the "Secure" checkbox is checked
   - SAVE the environment group

## How to Verify It's Correct

After updating and running the build, you should see:
```
Certificate MD5: 7bdf966d6f7c5279b8acb777b9129569
Base64 length: 4272
‚úì Password is: MyCoachFinder2024 (NEW certificate)
```

If you see:
```
‚ùå ERROR: Certificate does not match any known password!
```
Then the certificate is still corrupted and needs to be re-copied.

## Alternative: Use Terminal to Update

If you have Codemagic CLI access:
```bash
# Get the certificate value
CERT=$(cat /home/liz/Desktop/Module/MyCoachFinder/app/appel/certificates/ios_distribution_simple_base64.txt)

# Update via API (if you have access)
curl -X PATCH \
  -H "x-auth-token: wk5PJKmmO4_V70_6ZC6VMqWptvqGep6n95F6rR6HWgA" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"CM_CERTIFICATE\": \"$CERT\"}" \
  https://api.codemagic.io/apps/68fd6f2a7e282f2bab8b9665/env-vars
```

## Why This Happened

Common causes:
1. **Copy-paste issues**: Browser might have added hidden characters
2. **Length limits**: Some text fields have character limits
3. **Encoding issues**: Special characters in base64 got mangled
4. **Line breaks**: Certificate was split into multiple lines

## Prevention

- Always verify the base64 length is exactly 4,272 characters
- Use "View Source" or "Raw" mode when copying from GitHub
- Paste into a text editor first to check for line breaks
- Use the MD5 hash to verify: `7bdf966d6f7c5279b8acb777b9129569`
