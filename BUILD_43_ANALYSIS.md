# Build 43 - Patch Scripts Didn't Run Correctly

## Errors Found

1. **Line 73**: `trailing closure passed to parameter of type 'DispatchWorkItem' that does not accept a closure`
   - Location: `DispatchQueue.main.async {`
   - Issue: Original code still present (not patched)

2. **Line 164**: `value of type 'GIDGoogleUser' has no member 'serverAuthCode'`
   - Location: `user.serverAuthCode ?? NSNull()`
   - Issue: `serverAuthCode` was removed in GoogleSignIn 7.x!

## Analysis

### ✅ What Worked:
- Podspec patch DID work: `GID_SDK_VERSION=7.1.0` in logs
- GoogleSignIn 7.1.0 was installed
- Pod install succeeded

### ❌ What Didn't Work:
- Swift patch scripts didn't run or didn't fully fix the code
- Original Plugin.swift code still present (line 73 proves this)
- `serverAuthCode` access not removed/fixed

## Root Causes

1. **postinstall may not have run** - Codemagic might not show npm postinstall output in this log
2. **serverAuthCode was removed in GoogleSignIn 7.x** - Need to remove this field from response
3. **DispatchQueue syntax issue** - May be Swift 6 concurrency related (Xcode 16.4)

## Next Steps

Need to:
1. Verify postinstall scripts run on Codemagic
2. Remove `serverAuthCode` from patched code (doesn't exist in 7.x)
3. Fix any remaining API issues
