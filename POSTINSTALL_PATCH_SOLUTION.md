# ✅ Automatic Podspec Patch - FINAL SOLUTION

**Date**: 2025-11-02
**Issue**: CocoaPods dependency conflict on Codemagic
**Solution**: Automatic postinstall patch script
**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED AND PUSHED

---

## ❌ Why Previous Fix Didn't Work

### The Problem:
1. I modified the podspec in `node_modules/@codetrix-studio/capacitor-google-auth/`
2. **But** `node_modules/` is NOT committed to git (in .gitignore)
3. Codemagic runs `npm install` which downloads FRESH packages from npm
4. Result: Gets ORIGINAL podspec with GoogleSignIn 6.2.4 ❌

### Why Build 40 Failed AGAIN:
```
Codemagic:
1. git clone (gets our code)
2. npm install (downloads packages from npm with OLD podspec)
3. pod install (fails - dependency conflict!)
```

---

## ✅ New Solution: Automatic Patch After npm install

### What I Created:

**File**: `scripts/patch-google-auth-podspec.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Automatically patches the podspec after npm install
# Changes GoogleSignIn 6.2.4 → 7.1
# Changes deployment target 12.0 → 14.0
```

**Added to package.json**:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "bash scripts/patch-google-auth-podspec.sh"
  }
}
```

### How It Works:

```
Codemagic build:
1. git clone ✅ (gets our code + patch script)
2. npm install ✅
   └─ Downloads packages from npm
   └─ Runs postinstall script automatically
      └─ Patches podspec: GoogleSignIn 6.2.4 → 7.1 ✅
3. pod install ✅ (succeeds - no conflict!)
4. Build app ✅
```

**The patch happens AUTOMATICALLY after every npm install!**

---

## 🎯 What the Patch Script Does

### 1. Finds the Podspec File
```bash
PODSPEC_FILE="node_modules/@codetrix-studio/capacitor-google-auth/CodetrixStudioCapacitorGoogleAuth.podspec"
```

### 2. Patches GoogleSignIn Dependency
```bash
# Before:
s.dependency 'GoogleSignIn', '~> 6.2.4'

# After:
s.dependency 'GoogleSignIn', '~> 7.1'
```

### 3. Updates iOS Deployment Target
```bash
# Before:
s.ios.deployment_target = '12.0'

# After:
s.ios.deployment_target = '14.0'
```

### 4. Verifies Success
```bash
✅ Successfully patched GoogleSignIn dependency to 7.1
✅ Successfully updated deployment target to 14.0
✅ Podspec patch completed successfully
```

## 🔍 How to Verify on Codemagic

### During Build - Check Logs:

**Step 1: "Install npm dependencies"**
Look for:
```
Running postinstall script...
📝 Patching GoogleSignIn dependency...
✅ Successfully patched GoogleSignIn dependency to 7.1
```

**Step 2: "Install CocoaPods dependencies"**
Look for:
```
Analyzing dependencies
Downloading dependencies
Installing GoogleSignIn (7.1.0)    ← Should show 7.1.x!
Installing GTMAppAuth (4.1.1)
Installing GTMSessionFetcher (3.3.0)

[!] CocoaPods could not find...   ← Should NOT appear!
```

If you see these, the patch worked! ✅

## 🎯 Why This Solution Works

### Previous Attempts:
1. ❌ Updated Podfile only → Plugin still requires 6.2.4
2. ❌ Manually edited podspec → Not in git, lost after npm install
3. ❌ Modified podspec + committed → node_modules not in git!

### Current Solution:
✅ **Automatic patch script that runs AFTER npm install**
- Script IS in git (committed)
- Runs automatically (postinstall hook)
- Patches fresh npm packages every time
- Works on Codemagic, local dev, everywhere!

---

## 🔄 How It Works Locally Too

If you run `npm install` locally:
```bash
npm install
→ Downloading packages...
→ Running postinstall script...
✅ Successfully patched GoogleSignIn dependency to 7.1

cd ios/App && pod install
✅ Pod installation complete!
```

**The patch is automatic everywhere!** 🎉

## 📝 Alternative Solutions Considered

### Option 1: Fork the Plugin
- Fork @codetrix-studio/capacitor-google-auth
- Publish our own version with GoogleSignIn 7.1
- **Rejected**: Too much maintenance overhead

### Option 2: Switch Plugins
- Use different Google Auth plugin
- **Rejected**: Would require code changes

### Option 3: Use patch-package npm module
- Use `patch-package` to create persistent patches
- **Rejected**: Adds extra dependency

### Option 4: Custom postinstall script ✅
- **Selected**: Simple, no extra dependencies, automatic

## 🎯 Summary

**Problem**: Plugin requires GoogleSignIn 6.2.4, we need 7.1

**Root cause**: node_modules not in git, manual edits lost after npm install

**Solution**: Automatic postinstall patch script

**How it works**:
1. Codemagic runs `npm install`
2. Postinstall script auto-patches podspec
3. `pod install` succeeds with GoogleSignIn 7.1
4. App builds with privacy manifests ✅

**Status**: ✅ Pushed to remote, ready to build
