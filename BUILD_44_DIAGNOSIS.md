# Build 44 - Patches Still Didn't Apply

**Issue**: Same line 73 error as build 43
**Diagnosis**: Swift patches didn't run
**Solution**: Added robust verification to fail fast

---

## üî¥ Build 44 Error

```
‚ùå  Plugin.swift:73:34: trailing closure passed to parameter of type 'DispatchWorkItem'
    DispatchQueue.main.async {
```

**This is the EXACT same error from build 43!**

The fact that it's on **line 73** with the **original code** proves the Swift patch didn't apply.

---

## üîç Why Patches Might Not Be Running

### Possibility 1: Patch Step Didn't Execute
- Codemagic might have skipped it
- Or it failed silently without stopping the build

### Possibility 2: Patch Step Ran But Failed
- Scripts might have errors
- File paths might be wrong on Codemagic
- Python might not be available

### Possibility 3: Patches Applied But Got Overwritten
- Something ran after patches that restored original files
- Less likely but possible

---

## ‚úÖ Fix Applied: Robust Verification

Updated `codemagic.yaml` patch step to:

1. **Check file exists before patching**
   ```bash
   if [ ! -f "node_modules/.../Plugin.swift" ]; then
     echo "‚ùå ERROR: Plugin.swift not found!"
     exit 1
   fi
   ```

2. **Clear section headers**
   ```
   =========================================
   Running Google Auth patches...
   =========================================
   ```

3. **Verify patches applied**
   ```bash
   if grep -q "user.accessToken.tokenString" Plugin.swift; then
     echo "‚úÖ Swift patch verified"
   else
     echo "‚ùå ERROR: Swift patch failed!"
     exit 1  # FAIL THE BUILD HERE!
   fi
   ```

4. **Fail immediately if verification fails**
   - Don't proceed to pod install if patches didn't work
   - Save 10+ minutes of wasted build time

## üéØ What to Look For in Build 45

### Scenario A: Patch Step Succeeds

If you see in the logs:
```
=========================================
Running Google Auth patches for GoogleSignIn 7.x compatibility...
=========================================
‚úÖ Plugin.swift found
--- Running podspec patch ---
‚úÖ Successfully patched GoogleSignIn dependency to 7.1
--- Running Swift patch ---
‚úÖ Patched accessToken
‚úÖ Patched idToken (optional)
‚úÖ Patched refreshToken
--- Verifying patches ---
‚úÖ Swift patch verified: accessToken.tokenString found
‚úÖ Podspec patch verified: GoogleSignIn 7.1 found
=========================================
‚úÖ All patches applied and verified successfully!
=========================================
```

**Then patches worked!** Build should succeed.

### Scenario B: Patch Step Fails

If you see:
```
‚ùå ERROR: Plugin.swift not found!
```
OR
```
‚ùå ERROR: Swift patch failed - accessToken.tokenString not found!
```

**Build will STOP here** (won't waste time on compilation).

**Then** we know patches aren't applying and can debug why.

### Scenario C: Patch Step Doesn't Appear

If you don't see the patch step output at all:
- Codemagic might not be running it
- Or there's a YAML syntax error

**Then** we need to check codemagic.yaml syntax.

## üìã Next Steps

### For User:

**After triggering build 45, send me**:
1. **Full build log** (not just the last step)
2. **Specifically the "Patch Google Auth plugin" step output**
3. **Or screenshot of the build steps list**

This will tell us exactly what's happening with the patches.

### For Me (Based on Results):

**If patches still don't apply**:
- May need to switch to a different approach (e.g., fork the plugin)
- Or use a different Google Auth plugin
- Or patch files directly in git (not in node_modules)

**If patches apply but build still fails**:
- Different error (not line 73)
- Can debug the new error

---

## üéØ Summary

**Build 44 failed with the same error = patches didn't run**

**Added robust verification to fail fast and give clear output**

**Next build (45) will immediately show if patches work or fail**

**No more 10-minute build cycles to discover patches didn't apply!**

---

## üöÄ Trigger Build 45

Go to Codemagic and start build 45.

Watch the logs for the "Patch Google Auth plugin for GoogleSignIn 7.x" step output.

Send me those logs so we can see exactly what's happening!
