# Debugging os=apple Parameter - Still Not Working

## üî¥ Current Status

The os=apple parameter is **STILL NOT being added** despite all fixes.

Your debug JavaScript shows the URL **WITHOUT** os=apple parameter.

---

## üîç What We Need to Find Out

We've added **extensive logging and debugging tools** to find out why it's not working:

### Question 1: Is the plugin even loading?

**How to check:**
1. Build app v1.5
2. Open in Xcode
3. Look for console log:
   ```
   [OSParameter] ‚úÖ Plugin loaded - will intercept ALL navigation to add os=apple
   ```

**If you DON'T see this:**
- Plugin is NOT loading
- Problem: Plugin registration or build issue

**If you DO see this:**
- Plugin IS loading
- Problem: shouldOverrideLoad() isn't working or being called

### Question 2: Is shouldOverrideLoad() being called?

**How to check:**
Look for console log:
```
[OSParameter] üîç shouldOverrideLoad CALLED!
[OSParameter] üîç Checking URL: https://...
```

**If you DON'T see this:**
- shouldOverrideLoad() is NEVER called
- Problem: Capacitor might not support this hook, or initial load bypasses it

**If you DO see this:**
- shouldOverrideLoad() IS being called
- Check what it logs next to see why parameter isn't added

### Question 3: What URLs is it seeing?

**Look for:**
```
[OSParameter] üîç Checking URL: https://app.my-coach-finder.com/...
[OSParameter] üîç Host: app.my-coach-finder.com
```

This tells us what URLs the plugin is actually intercepting.

## üß™ Manual Testing Tool

We've added a tool to manually force the parameter:

### Open This Page in the App:

```
force-os-parameter.html
```

### What It Does:

1. **Shows current URL** - with or without os=apple
2. **Shows ‚úÖ/‚ùå** - if parameter is present
3. **"Force Add os=apple" button** - manually calls plugin method
4. **"Test Plugin Available"** - checks if plugin is loaded
5. **Debug log** - shows all actions and results

### How to Use:

```
1. Build app v1.5
2. Install via TestFlight
3. In the app, navigate to: force-os-parameter.html
4. Click "Test Plugin Available"
   - If plugin is available: ‚úÖ Good
   - If plugin NOT available: ‚ùå Plugin isn't loading

5. Click "Force Add os=apple"
   - This manually calls the plugin
   - Should reload page with ?os=apple
   - Check if it works

6. Try navigating to Login
   - Click "Go to Login"
   - See if os=apple is added
```

## üìã What to Send Me

After building v1.5 and testing:

### 1. Xcode Console Logs

Send me the console output showing:
```
[OSParameter] ...
```

Specifically:
- Does it say "Plugin loaded"?
- Does it say "shouldOverrideLoad CALLED"?
- What URLs does it log?
- Any errors?

### 2. force-os-parameter.html Results

Open the test page and send me:
- Is plugin available? (‚úÖ/‚ùå)
- What does clicking "Force Add os=apple" do?
- Does it work?
- What's in the debug log?

### 3. Current URL

What URL do you see in the app when you open it?
- Does it have ?os=apple from capacitor.config.json?
- Or is it clean without any parameter?

## ü§î Possible Issues

Based on what we find, here are the possible problems:

### Scenario A: Plugin Not Loading

**Symptoms:**
- No "[OSParameter] Plugin loaded" log
- Plugin not available in force-os-parameter.html

**Possible causes:**
- CAP_PLUGIN registration not working
- Plugin not compiled into app
- Capacitor version incompatibility

**Fix:**
- Check Capacitor version
- Try different plugin registration syntax
- Verify plugin is in build

### Scenario B: shouldOverrideLoad Not Called

**Symptoms:**
- "[OSParameter] Plugin loaded" shows ‚úÖ
- But NO "shouldOverrideLoad CALLED" logs

**Possible causes:**
- shouldOverrideLoad() not supported in this Capacitor version
- Initial load bypasses this hook
- Navigation method doesn't trigger it

**Fix:**
- Use different Capacitor hook
- Use WKNavigationDelegate instead
- Inject JavaScript on page load

### Scenario C: Method Called But Not Working

**Symptoms:**
- "shouldOverrideLoad CALLED" shows ‚úÖ
- Logs show it's checking URLs
- But parameter still not added

**Possible causes:**
- URL modification not working
- Return value not correct
- WebView reload failing

**Fix:**
- Debug the URL modification code
- Try different approach
- Use JavaScript injection instead

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Build v1.5** with all the debugging code
2. **Install** via TestFlight
3. **Open Xcode** console to see logs
4. **Navigate** in the app and watch logs
5. **Open force-os-parameter.html** and test
6. **Send me**:
   - Console logs
   - Test page results
   - What URL you actually see

With this information, I can determine the exact problem and fix it!

## üìù Quick Test Checklist

After building v1.5:

- [ ] Open app in Xcode
- [ ] Check console for "[OSParameter] Plugin loaded"
- [ ] Check console for "shouldOverrideLoad CALLED"
- [ ] Navigate to a page, see what logs appear
- [ ] Open force-os-parameter.html
- [ ] Click "Test Plugin Available"
- [ ] Click "Force Add os=apple"
- [ ] Check if parameter appears in URL
- [ ] Try navigating to /auth/login
- [ ] Send me the console logs and results

This will tell us EXACTLY what's wrong!
